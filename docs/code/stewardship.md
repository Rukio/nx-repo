> Stewardship is an ethic that embodies the responsible planning and management of resources.

## Overview

The term `Stewardship` combines two concepts from Google

- Google `Code Readability`
- YouTube `OldTubers`.

See [Inspiration](#inspiration) for details.

`Stewardship` is the generalization of the [Code Style Guide](style.md).

`Stewardship` is the mechanism for guiding stewardship of our codebase, ensuring every team member has a shared mindset of striving to do what is best for the organization.

## General Principles

`Stewardship` applies at both the language level and the codebase level.

Developers who have become `Stewards`:

- Understand and consistently follow all the other principles laid out in various guides, including:
  - [Code Style Guide](style.md)
  - [Developer Guide](developer.md)
  - [Reviewer Guide](reviewer.md)
- Demonstrate broad enough knowledge of the system as a whole to make good decisions about design and implementation tradeoffs
- Know who to consult when making decisions that may affect many people
  - E.g., when introducing new processes, consider the costs and effects on the organization
- Coach others to do the same and hold each other accountable to preserve the quality and usability of the codebase

## Earning `Stewardship`

1. Code normally
1. Continue to get code reviews, following the General Principles
1. Depending on hand-wavy factors including the quality and complexity of the code reviews, developer will be granted `Stewardship`.

## Appendix

### Inspiration

There aren't many public references to these concepts, so here's a brief summary (as they're internal processes).

#### Google `Code Readability`

Google `Code Readability` is about knowing the good ways to handle different situations in a particular language. It's partly `CODEOWNERS` for language.

- Knowing codebase language idioms
- Using readable patterns
- Picking the right tools for the job
- Earned via lots of code reviews by people with `Readability`
- Limited reference (not complete):

#### YouTube `OldTubers`

YouTube `OldTubers` was a group equivalent to `CODEOWNERS` that had full access to the codebase.

- Knowing codebase idioms
- Writing code that meshes well with all other components
- Picking the right tools for the job
- Not adding undue dependencies
- Making good tradeoffs for maintainability
- Earned via lots of code reviews by people with `OldTubers`
- More liberal than Google Code Readability
